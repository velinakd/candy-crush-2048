Judy
====

Judy is an interactive game that could be played through a GUI or a CLI. Its main purpose is to destroy the blocks in the 2D field by clicking on a block chosen by the user. If the given block is part of a group of at least three neighbouring blocks of the same kind, the whole group will disappear.

As you proceed through the game and go up through the levels, the number of different kinds of blocks increases. You can go up a level if you have destroyed a sufficient amount of the blocks on the screen. You get points for every destroyed group of blocks. The bigger the group is, the more points you acquire.

There are also bombs that, when clicked, destroy themselves and all neighbouring blocks. Another advantage is that upon entering the game, you can choose among a few tile themes.

Plan for Milestone 2
--------------------
To have an initial object model implementation (the `Field` and `Block` classes).

To decide on the parameters of the game: points rewarding, requirements for passing a level, etc.
